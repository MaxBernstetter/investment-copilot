# Simplicity

Build the simplest thing that fully solves the problem. Complexity is added only when a real requirement forces it.

## Rules

- **YAGNI:** implement what the current issue needs. No speculative options, hooks or abstractions.
- **KISS:** prefer plain, boring solutions: a SQL query over a framework, a function over a class hierarchy, a config value over a plugin system.
- **One reason to exist:** every module, endpoint and table has one clear responsibility you can state in a sentence.
- **Deep, not wide:** small interfaces with real behaviour behind them. If a layer only passes calls through, remove it.
- **Two cases before abstracting:** don't abstract over one implementation. Wait for the second real one (rule of three for shared helpers).
- **Delete freely:** dead code, unused flags and obsolete paths are removed, not commented out.

## Simplicity vs. the architecture

The architecture deliberately accepts some structural complexity (separate services, contracts, bitemporal model) because the requirements demand it. Within that structure, each piece should be as simple as possible:

- Use the standard interfaces (REST conventions, transparency contract) rather than inventing variants.
- Use the platform (Airflow, observability stack) rather than re-implementing scheduling, retries or monitoring inside a service.

## Self-check

- Could a new team member understand this piece in ten minutes?
- What can I remove and still meet the acceptance criteria?
- Is any part here "just in case"?
